INTRODUCTION                                                   *PlatformIO*

A plugin for wrapping PlatformIO commands with user-friendly Neovim commands.

==============================================================================

USAGE                                                    *platformio-usage*

                                   *:Pioinit*
:Pioinit                 Open Neovim in a fresh directory, run `:Pioinit`, and
                         follow the prompt to initialize a project. A telescope
                         picker will appear for selecting the board, and then
                         another for choosing the framework. Press enter to
                         complete the initialization.

                                   *:Piorun*
:Piorun [arg]            This command builds and uploads the code. Optional
                         arguments: build, upload, clean. If no argument is
                         provided, it defaults to build and upload.
                         Examples:
                            `:Piorun`
                            `:Piorun build`
                            `:Piorun upload`
                            `:Piorun clean`

                                   *:Piocmd*
:Piocmd[f|h] [cmd]       Run PlatformIO commands either in float or horizontal direction.
                         Example: `:Piocmdf device list`.
                         The command argument is optional. If not provided, it
                         opens a floating toggleterm in the project root where
                         you can execute commands. Note: `pio` keyword is not
                         required in the command.
                         Examples:
                            `:Piocmdh`
                            `:Piocmdh run -e uno -t upload`
                            `:Piocmdf device list`
                            `:Piocmdf boards arduinouno --json-output`

                                   *:Piolib*
:Piolib [libname]       Install a library by providing a keyword for search. A
                         telescope picker will show available libraries. Pick
                         one and press enter to install.
                         Examples:
                            `:Piolib arduino json`
                            `:Piolib keyboard`

                                   *:Piomon*
:Piomon [baud_rate]     Open a serial monitor. Specify a baud rate as an
                         optional argument. If not provided, it uses the default
                         baud rate (9600) or the one specified in platformio.ini.
                         Examples:
                            `:Piomon`
                            `:Piomon 115200`

                                   *:Piolsserial*
:Piolsserial		List out all the serial devices connected with their
			description

                                   *:PioLSP*
:PioLSP			Generates LSP config and restart the LSP connection.
			It is based on your configuration. If `ccls` is
			picked it generates the `.ccls` file and if `clangd`
			is picked it generates `compile_commands.json` file.
			This command can be used in a fresh cloned project
			which doesnt have LSP configs. 

                                   *:Piodebug*
:Piodebug		 Starts the default PlatformIO debugger with gdb

                                   *:PioTermList
:PioTermList             You can see a list of pio terminals using :PioTermList
                         command in normal mode. It is mapped to <leader>pl


==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                        *platformio-configuration*

The plugin exposes a few configuration options that can be set in your
`setup()` call.

clangd_source                                          *platformio-clangd_source*
    PlatformIO CLI officially only supports generating LSP configuration for
    CCLS, since it creates a `.ccls` file when you use the `--ide=vim` flag.
    However, it does not generate any configuration for clangd. To get
    clangd working, we need a `compile_commands.json` file, which can be produced 
    in two different ways:

    - `ccls`
          This option uses the `.ccls` file generated by the PlatformIO
          CLI and creates a `compile_commands.json` based on it. It does
          this by extracting the compiler, `-I`, and `-D` flags from the
          `.ccls` file, which are essential for autocompletion.

    - `compiledb`
          This option generates the `compile_commands.json` file by running
          `pio run -t compiledb`.

    Initially, the plugin relied only on `compiledb` to generate configuration
    for `clangd`, but there were many reports—especially from users of the
    Espressif/ESP32 platform—about `clangd` throwing strange errors. This
    happens because the `compiledb` target produces a `compile_commands.json`
    intended for building the project, not for consumption by `clangd`, which
    often results in messy or incompatible entries.
    
    This led to the idea of generating a clean `compile_commands.json` using
    the `.ccls` file, picking only the `-I` and `-D` flags and ignoring
    everything else. This usually provides much better autocompletion, though
    it is still not perfect in all cases.
    
    Try both methods and choose the one that works best for your setup. I am
    also open to suggestions to further improve clangd support.
